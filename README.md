# css-gradients
I found this interesting topic in CSS.
CSS gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.
CSS defines two types of gradients:
Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)
Radial Gradients (defined by their center)
I made one that shows how to create a linear gradient (from left to right) with the color of the rainbow and some text.
